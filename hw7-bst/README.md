# HW7 Binary Search Tree
This is an unbalanced binary search tree that holds keys of type String. 

## What I had to do
* Make a class called BinarySearchTree.java with the following methods:
  1. add() takes a String as input and inserts it into the appropriate position in the tree. 
  2. remove() takes a String as input and removes it from the tree. 
  3. lookup() takes a String as input and determines whether it appears in the tree
  4. inOrderTraverse() when called on the root prints all the keys in the tree in increasing order.
